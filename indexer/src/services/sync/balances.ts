/**
 * Balances Synchronization Service
 *
 * This module provides functionality to synchronize account balance information
 * in the Kadena blockchain indexer. Balances represent the ownership of tokens
 * (both fungible and non-fungible) across different chains and accounts.
 *
 * The service includes:
 * 1. Backfill functionality to rebuild the balances database from transfer history
 * 2. Optimized SQL operations to handle large datasets efficiently
 * 3. Conflict handling to ensure data consistency
 *
 * Balances are central to tracking token ownership, distribution, and wealth across
 * the blockchain ecosystem. This service ensures the indexer maintains a comprehensive
 * and consistent view of token balances derived from transfer activities.

/**
 * Backfills balance information by aggregating data from the Transfers table.
 *
 * This function performs a balance reconstruction by:
 * 1. Identifying all unique account-module-chain combinations from transfer records
 * 2. Creating balance entries for each unique combination
 * 3. Using SQL features to optimize the operation and handle conflicts
 *
 * Rather than calculating actual balance amounts, this function focuses on creating
 * the necessary balance records. The actual balance amounts are computed separately
 * through aggregation of transfer data when needed.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the backfill is complete
