/**
 * Type definitions for the gas estimation system
 *
 * This file defines the type interfaces used by the gas estimation system. Gas is the
 * execution fee mechanism in the Kadena blockchain, similar to Ethereum's gas concept.
 * The types defined here enable the system to handle various input formats for
 * estimating the gas cost of transactions before they're submitted to the blockchain.
 *
 * The system supports multiple input formats to provide flexibility for different
 * client use cases, from complete transactions to simple Pact code snippets.
