/**
 * Transforms a database block entity into a GraphQL-compatible format
 *
 * This function takes a BlockOutput from the database repository and converts it into
 * a structure that matches the Block type in the GraphQL schema. It preserves all the
 * scalar properties from the original block entity and adds placeholder objects for
 * related entities that will be resolved by separate field resolvers.
 *
 * The placeholder objects (parent, events, minerAccount, transactions) allow the
 * GraphQL resolver system to identify which fields need to be resolved, while avoiding
 * unnecessary database queries for fields that aren't requested in the client query.
 *
 * @param output - The block entity from the database repository
 * @returns A GraphQL-compatible block object with placeholders for related entities
