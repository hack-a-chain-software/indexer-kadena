/**
 * Transforms a database fungible account entity into a GraphQL-compatible format
 *
 * This function takes a FungibleAccountOutput from the database repository and converts it into
 * a structure that matches the FungibleAccount type in the GraphQL schema. It preserves all the
 * scalar properties from the original account entity and adds placeholder objects and arrays
 * for related entities that will be resolved by separate field resolvers.
 *
 * The placeholder objects (chainAccounts, transactions, transfers) allow the GraphQL resolver
 * system to identify which fields need to be resolved, while avoiding unnecessary database
 * queries for fields that aren't requested in the client query.
 *
 * @param account - The fungible account entity from the database repository
 * @returns A GraphQL-compatible fungible account object with placeholders for related entities
