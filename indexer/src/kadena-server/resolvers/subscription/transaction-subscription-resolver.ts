/**
 * GraphQL subscription resolver for real-time transaction updates

 * to the blockchain. It uses an AsyncGenerator to poll for the transaction until it's found.

/**
 * AsyncGenerator function that polls for a specific transaction
 *
 * This function creates a polling loop that checks for a transaction with the
 * specified request key. Once the transaction is found, it retrieves all versions
 * of the transaction (including any potential orphaned versions from chain reorganizations),
 * orders them by block depth, and yields the result.
 *
 * The function terminates after yielding the first result, effectively providing
 * a one-time notification when the transaction is added to the blockchain.
 *
 * @param requestKey - The unique request key of the transaction to monitor
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repositories and control signals
 * @param chainId - Optional chain ID to filter transactions by specific chain
 * @returns AsyncGenerator that yields the transaction when found

 *
 * The resolver allows clients to monitor a specific transaction by its request key,
