/**
 * GraphQL subscription resolver for real-time block updates

 * It uses an AsyncGenerator to continuously poll for new blocks and push them to subscribed clients.

/**
 * AsyncGenerator function that continuously polls for new blocks
 *
 * This function creates a polling loop that checks for new blocks at regular intervals.
 * It keeps track of the last seen block ID to avoid sending duplicate blocks, and uses
 * a starting timestamp to limit results to blocks created after the subscription started.
 *
 * The function maintains its state between iterations, allowing it to effectively paginate
 * through new blocks as they are created on the blockchain.
 *
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repositories and control signals
 * @param chainIds - Array of chain IDs to filter blocks by (empty array means all chains)
 * @param quantity - The number of blocks to fetch per poll
 * @returns AsyncGenerator that yields arrays of new blocks as they are discovered

 *
 * The resolver filters blocks by chain ID if specified, or returns blocks from all chains if no filter is provided.
