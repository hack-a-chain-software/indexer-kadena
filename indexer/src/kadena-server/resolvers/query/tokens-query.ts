 * Resolver function for the 'tokens' query

 * returning a connection of token information.
 *
 * The resolver implements the GraphQL Connection specification for pagination,
 * returning edges with cursors and pageInfo for navigation.
 *
 * @param _parent - Parent resolver object (unused in this root resolver)
 * @param args - GraphQL query arguments containing pagination parameters
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repository implementations
 * @returns Promise resolving to a tokens connection with pagination info
