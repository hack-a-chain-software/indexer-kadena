/**
 * Resolver function for the 'block' query
 *
 * This resolver handles requests for a specific blockchain block identified by its
 * hash. It delegates to the block repository to fetch the block data from the database,
 * then transforms the result into the GraphQL-compatible format using the block builder.
 *
 * The resolver acts as a thin layer between the GraphQL schema and the data access layer,
 * primarily handling parameter extraction and result transformation.
 *
 * @param _parent - Parent resolver object (unused in this root resolver)
 * @param args - GraphQL query arguments containing the block hash
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repository implementations
 * @returns Promise resolving to a GraphQL-compatible Block object or null if not found
