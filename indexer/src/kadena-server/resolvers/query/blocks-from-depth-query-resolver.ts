 * (number of confirmations). This is particularly useful for applications that need data
 * with a certain level of finality.

/**
 * Resolver function for the 'blocksFromDepth' query
 *
 * This resolver handles requests for blockchain blocks filtered by confirmation depth.
 * It delegates to the block repository to fetch blocks that have reached the
 * minimum confirmation depth specified in the arguments, then transforms the
 * results into the GraphQL-compatible format using the block builder.
 *
 * The resolver supports filtering by chain ID and implements the GraphQL Connection
 * specification for pagination, returning edges with cursors and pageInfo for navigation.
 *
 * @param _parent - Parent resolver object (unused in this root resolver)
 * @param args - GraphQL query arguments including minimumDepth, chainIds, and pagination parameters
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repository implementations
 * @returns Promise resolving to a blocks connection with edges and pagination info
