/**
 * Resolver function for the 'graphConfiguration' query
 *
 * This resolver handles requests for API configuration information.
 * It combines dynamic data from the block repository (like the minimum indexed block height)
 * with static configuration values (like the API version) to provide clients with
 * information about the capabilities and limitations of the API.
 *
 * This information is particularly useful for clients that need to know
 * how far back in the blockchain they can query data.
 *
 * @param _args - Parent object (unused in this root resolver)
 * @param _parent - GraphQL query arguments (unused in this resolver)
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repository implementations
 * @returns Promise resolving to a GraphConfiguration object with API configuration details
