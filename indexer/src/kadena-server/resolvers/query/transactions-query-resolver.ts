/**
 * GraphQL resolver for the 'transactions' query with advanced filtering
 *
 * This module implements a GraphQL resolver for the 'transactions' query in the Kadena blockchain indexer.
 * The resolver provides a flexible interface for querying blockchain transactions with various
 * filtering criteria and pagination support.
 *
 * Key features include:
 * 1. Filtering transactions by account, block, chain, token, or request key
 * 2. Support for height-based and confirmation depth-based filtering
 * 3. Cursor-based pagination with first/last and before/after parameters
 * 4. Proper GraphQL connection pattern implementation for large result sets
 * 5. Input validation to ensure at least one filtering parameter is provided
 *
 * This resolver bridges the GraphQL API layer with the repository layer, providing
 * a clean interface for transaction data access.

/**
 * GraphQL resolver function for the 'transactions' query.
 *
 * This resolver handles requests for transaction data with support for various
 * filtering parameters and pagination. It enforces business rules about required parameters
 * and transforms repository data into the format expected by the GraphQL schema.
 *
 * The resolver implements the GraphQL Connection specification for pagination,
 * returning edges with cursors, pageInfo for navigation, and additional metadata
 * that will be used by field resolvers (like totalCount).
 *
 * @param _parent - Parent resolver object (unused in this root resolver)
 * @param args - GraphQL query arguments containing filtering and pagination parameters
 * @param context - Resolver context containing the repository implementations
 * @returns Promise resolving to a transaction connection with edges, pagination info, and metadata
 * @throws Error if no filtering parameters are provided
