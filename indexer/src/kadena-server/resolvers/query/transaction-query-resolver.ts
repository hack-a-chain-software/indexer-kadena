/**
 * Resolver function for the 'transaction' query
 *
 * This resolver handles requests for a specific blockchain transaction identified by its
 * request key. It delegates to the transaction repository to fetch the transaction data,
 * then transforms the result into the GraphQL-compatible format using the transaction builder.
 *
 * The resolver also handles chain reorganizations by identifying and returning any orphaned
 * versions of the transaction (transactions that were included in blocks that are no longer
 * part of the main chain). It orders the transactions by block depth, with the "canonical"
 * transaction (the one in the deepest/most confirmed block) returned as the main result.
 *
 * @param _parent - Parent resolver object (unused in this root resolver)
 * @param args - GraphQL query arguments including requestKey, optional blockHash, and minimumDepth
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repository implementations
 * @returns Promise resolving to the transaction object with any orphaned versions, or null if not found
