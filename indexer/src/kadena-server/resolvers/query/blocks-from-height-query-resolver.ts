/**
 * Resolver function for the 'blocksFromHeight' query
 *
 * This resolver handles requests for blockchain blocks filtered by height.
 * It delegates to the block repository to fetch blocks within the height range
 * specified in the arguments, then transforms the results into the GraphQL-compatible
 * format using the block builder.
 *
 * The resolver implements the GraphQL Connection specification for pagination,
 * returning edges with cursors and pageInfo for navigation.
 *
 * @param _parent - Parent resolver object (unused in this root resolver)
 * @param args - GraphQL query arguments including height range and pagination parameters
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repository implementations
 * @returns Promise resolving to a blocks connection with edges and pagination info
