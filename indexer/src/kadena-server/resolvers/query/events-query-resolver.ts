/**
 * GraphQL resolver for the 'events' query with advanced filtering

 * which allows clients to retrieve blockchain events with various filtering options.
 * Events represent actions or state changes that occurred during transaction execution
 * on the Kadena blockchain.

/**
 * Resolver function for the 'events' query
 *
 * This resolver handles requests for blockchain event data with support for various
 * filtering parameters and pagination. It delegates to the event repository
 * to fetch the filtered data from the database, then transforms the results into
 * the GraphQL-compatible format using the event builder.
 *
 * The resolver supports multiple filtering dimensions:
 * - By qualified event name (module.name format)
 * - By block hash or height range
 * - By chain ID
 * - By transaction request key
 * - By minimum confirmation depth
 *
 * The resolver implements the GraphQL Connection specification for pagination,
 * returning edges with cursors, pageInfo for navigation, and additional metadata
 * that will be used by field resolvers (like totalCount).
 *
 * @param _parent - Parent resolver object (unused in this root resolver)
 * @param args - GraphQL query arguments containing filtering and pagination parameters
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repository implementations
 * @returns Promise resolving to an events connection with edges, pagination info, and metadata
