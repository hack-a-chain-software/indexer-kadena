/**
 * Resolver function for the 'transfers' query
 *
 * This resolver handles requests for token transfer data with support for various
 * filtering parameters and pagination. It delegates to the transfer repository
 * to fetch the filtered data from the database, then transforms the results into
 * the GraphQL-compatible format using the transfer builder.
 *
 * The resolver implements the GraphQL Connection specification for pagination,
 * returning edges with cursors, pageInfo for navigation, and additional metadata
 * that will be used by field resolvers (like totalCount).
 *
 * @param _parent - Parent resolver object (unused in this root resolver)
 * @param args - GraphQL query arguments containing filtering and pagination parameters
 * @param context - Resolver context containing repository implementations
 * @returns Promise resolving to a transfers connection with edges, pagination info, and metadata
