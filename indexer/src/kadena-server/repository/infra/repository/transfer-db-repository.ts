/**
 * Database implementation of the TransferRepository interface

 * This file provides a concrete implementation of the TransferRepository interface

 * Kadena blockchain.
 *
 * The implementation includes support for:
 * - Retrieving transfers with complex filtering options
 * - Querying transfers by block, transaction, or account
 * - Supporting cross-chain transfers through pact IDs
 * - Paginated access with cursor-based navigation
 * - Counting transfers for statistics and pagination
