/**
 * Event Model Definition
 *
 * This module defines the Event model, which represents blockchain events emitted during transaction execution.
 * Events are critical for tracking state changes, transfers, and other significant actions that occur
 * during transaction processing in the Kadena blockchain.
 *
 * The model provides:
 * 1. Core event attributes and structure
 * 2. Database schema definition with indexes for efficient querying
 * 3. Relationship definitions to associated transactions
 *
 * Events serve as the primary mechanism for external systems to observe and react to
 * blockchain state changes without directly querying the blockchain.
